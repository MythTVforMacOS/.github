# MythTV for macOS
This is unofficial set of repositories that support compiling [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/) for macOS. the current repositories are:

**compileMythtvTV** - This houses the latest build and codesigning scripts as well as the github action code that automates the build process.  These files are synched regularaly with the official [MythTV packaging](https://github.com/MythTV/packaging) repository. 

This now script supports both MacPorts and Homebrew based compilation of both mythfrontend and mythbackend.

**Note: This is unofficial MythTV site!!!**  Please visit the [MythTV site](https://www.mythtv.org/) for the main project, and their official [GitHub site](https://github.com/MythTV) for the official code and issues tracker.

# SourceForge Repository
A large reopository of past (and current) MythTV / Mythfrontend builds are housed here at the [SourceForge site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mythtvformacosx/) (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mythtvformacosx/).  These builds are updated weekly for x86_64 if any upstream code changes are made.  The arm64 builds are updated periodically.  The automatic builds are generated from github actions hosted on this site.

# Support
Support for using the compile script is available on this website, please file an [Issue](https://github.com/MythTVforMacOS/compileMythTV/issues) or would like to make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/MythTVforMacOS/compileMythTV/pulls) as apporpriate.

Support for **compiling or troubleshooting mythtv specific issues** will be referred to the official mythtv mailing list (http://lists.mythtv.org/mailman/listinfo/mythtv-users) and forums (https://forum.mythtv.org/). Please do not get offended if you are referred to these forums for help as opposed to the github Issues tracker.
